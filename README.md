# Dall-eWChatCPT
This code gets an input and sends that input to ChatCPT asking it to write the input in a fashion Dall-E could draw easily, then it sends ChatCPT's response to Dall-E and it creates an image out of it, then code opens up that image on desktop. First one uses cv2 to do so and second one uses mathplotlib.
